## About

### Reflex (previously Pynecone)

[Reflex](https://reflex.dev/) (previously [Pynecone](https://pynecone.io/)) is a Python framework for building web apps. The code is transpiled to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), placed in the `.web/` directory.

### Hosting

The website is static, hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

### Content

The content is pulled from the [`python-usergroup-belgium/.github`](https://github.com/python-usergroup-belgium/.github) as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules), updated daily. Changes should be made there.

### Dependencies

Dependencies and environments are tracked using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

### GitHub Actions (CICD)

Updates on the content ([`python-usergroup-belgium/.github`](https://github.com/python-usergroup-belgium/.github) repo) are updated and deployed daily. Pushing changes on `main` branch also triggers a rebuild and redeployment. See the [nextjs.yml](https://github.com/python-usergroup-belgium/pynecone-website/blob/main/.github/workflows/nextjs.yml) for more info.
